## Appendices & Byelaws

### Appendix 1. Nominations for Pub of the Season (POTS)

_Added to byelaws at branch meeting on Tuesday 16th February 2016 at 
Blundell’s Café Bar._

If a pub is selected as a Pub of the Season, that pub will become ineligible
for nomination for the following three Pub of the Season awards.

E.g. if Wigan Central is voted as Pub of the Season for Spring 2016, it will
become ineligible for nomination for Pub of the Season Summer 2016, Autumn 2016
and Winter 2016. The next opportunity to nominate Wigan Central for the Pub of
the Season award will be Spring 2017.

### Appendix 2. Voting for Pub of the Season (POTS)

_Added to byelaws at branch meeting on Tuesday 16th February 2016 at
Blundell’s Café Bar._

If voting for a Pub of the Season award is taking place in a venue nominated
for the award, the voting should be concluded by way of a secret ballot as
opposed to an open show of hands as is the regular voting method.

### Appendix 3. Best New Cask Outlet award criteria

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Wednesday 17th January 2018 at Wigan
Central_

The award should go to a venue which has demonstrated its credentials over a
period of between four and sixteen calendar months from its opening or
conversion to a cask outlet

### Appendix 4. Sexist or suggestive pump clips at Wigan Beer Festival

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Wednesday 17th January 2018 at Wigan
Central_

CAMRA has clear policy on equal opportunity and discrimination. In view of this
Wigan branch agrees to adopt policies which encourage participation by all who
share our love of beer, real cider, and pubs. All members should feel
comfortable in the company of branch members and at our organised events. To
that end it is agreed that our festival will not feature any products which
have sexist or suggestive pump clips or names. Any member demonstrating
behaviour which breaches CAMRAs policies on Equality and Discrimination will be
formally challenged and if necessary reported to CAMRA’s disciplinary panel.

### Appendix 5. Voting for Pub of the Season (POTS) by proxy

_12 month trial agreed at branch meeting on Tuesday 11th April 2017 at the Tap
‘n’ Barrel._

The new voting system was trialled for a period of twelve months and used to
determine POTS for the following periods: Summer 2017; Autumn 2017
Winter 2017; Spring 2018. The trial was reviewed during the branch meeting on
Thursday 19 th April 2018 at Wigan Brewhouse and permanently added to the
branch byelaws.

A branch member who is unable to attend the meeting during which voting for
POTS is taking place may cast her/his vote by proxy providing s/he sends
apologies for absence from the meeting along with an attending branch member.
The apology must be written down (either on paper or via email or text message)
and be able to be produced by the attending member at the time of voting. The
apology should be accompanied by the wish to vote by proxy and the name of the
pub that the member wishes to vote for. It is recommended that the absent
member also includes her/his CAMRA membership number in the interest of checks
being made retrospectively to ensure that the absent member’s branch membership
is current and therefore s/he is eligible to vote for POTS.

#### Limitations: -

* An attending member at the branch meeting may only carry a maximum of two proxy
    votes for absent members;
* Should more than two absentees contact an attending branch member to pass on
    apologies, apologies may be accepted but only the first two proxy votes
    should be accepted by that member;
* By accepting a proxy vote from a non-attending member and casting it on
    her/his behalf, the attending member is vouching for the eligibility of the
    absent member to vote;
* Should any abuse of the voting system be discovered either at the time of
    voting or afterwards, appropriate disciplinary measures will be taken;
* Should any abuse of the voting system be discovered either at the time of
    voting or afterwards, an investigation will be undertaken to verify the
    validity of the award.
* The number of meetings a member has attended does not affect her/his right to
    vote;
* An absent member must directly ask an attending member to pass on apologies
    and vote;

### Appendix 6. Formalisation of Branch Pub of the Year (POTY) voting

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Wednesday 16th January 2019 at Wigan
Central_

#### Eligibility for nomination

All of the pubs that are in the current published version of the Good Beer
Guide are automatically nominated for Branch POTY, providing that at the point
of voting for the award, the pub is still eligible to be in the GBG as per the
branch regulations.

In addition, the previous four winners of branch Pub of the Season will also be
automatically nominated, again providing that the pub is eligible to be in the
GBG at the point in time of voting.

Under exceptional circumstances, additional nominations may be taken from the
floor during the AGM and, if seconded, the pub will be added to the list of
nominees at the discretion of the Branch Chair (or Acting Chair, should the
Branch Chair not be chairing the AGM).

#### Voting – phase one

Once the list of nominees is complete, a ballot by show of hands (regardless of
meeting location) will be taken. The ballot will entitle each branch member at
the AGM to a single vote for a pub during this phase. The four pubs with the
greatest number of votes will form a shortlist for phase two of voting. In the
case of a tied number of votes during phase one, the Branch Chair (or Acting
Chair) will determine the most appropriate way to form the shortlist.

#### Voting – phase two

Each attending branch member will have the option to take part in a secret
ballot (regardless of meeting location). Members may vote for a single pub from
the shortlist during this phase. The votes will be collected and counted and
the pub with the greatest number of votes shall win Branch POTY. In the case of
a tie, the Branch Chair (or Acting Chair) will break the deadlock with a casting
vote.

### Appendix 7: Branch Chair may nominate and vote for annual awards

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Wednesday 16th January 2019 at Wigan
Central_

This motion proposed that the convention be done away with, enabling the Chair
to nominate and vote for awards like any other member of the branch should s/he
wish.

### Appendix 8: Qualification for LocAle award

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Wednesday 16th January 2019 at Wigan
Central_

Criteria for qualification for LocAle award are as follows: -

* There should always be a locally brewed real ale available on the bar
  * “Locally brewed” defined as a beer brewed by any brewery within the branch
    boundaries or brewed by a brewery within ten miles of the pub by the
    shortest driving route
* The pub must have been open and serving locally brewed real ale for a minimum
    period of four months, in line with the minimum length of time a pub must
    have been open before becoming eligible for the annual ‘Best New Cask
    Outlet’ award
* The LocAle award will be valid for a period of twelve months after the pub is
    presented with the award and will automatically renew unless the pub is
    found to no longer be eligible for LocAle status (i.e. there is no longer
    locally brewed real ale available or it is found to not be of a good
    standard upon inspection)
* The beer must always be served to a high standard

Branch members are encouraged to regularly visit LocAle accredited pubs within
the branch and report back to the branch and LocAle Coordinator any positive or
negative findings from those visits. Naturally, there may be times when a
barrel of real ale has to be changed and a new locally brewed real ale might
not be immediately available. That should be taken into consideration when
considering eligibility.

### Appendix 9: Sub-committee to fulfil the role of Social Secretary

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Tuesday 14th January 2020 at Wigan Central_

A sub-committee will fulfil the duties required by the Social Secretary,
dividing the responsibilities between a number of officers in order to make the
role more manageable.

The sub-committee will be headed up by one officer, with the title of Social
Secretary. The Social Secretary will report directly to the Branch Chair

A number of officers may be elected to the role of Social Officer. The Social
Officer role will report to the Social Secretary.

Some activities in the official role description are already covered by other
officers within the branch and some do not particularly fit the way that the
branch currently operates, therefore the activities that would be required from
the sub-committee are: -

* Plan social trips, locally and farther afield, for current and prospective
    branch members;
* Plan an annual ‘Festival Volunteers Thankyou Trip’ for volunteers at Wigan
    Beer Festival;
* Attend branch meetings, festival planning meetings and other event meetings
    (e.g. Wigan Beer Week planning meetings) to feed into discussions
    surrounding social trips;
* Liaise with the Transport Officer for arrangements for transport for social
    trips;
* Liaise with the relevant BLO(s) when visiting breweries inside or outside of
    the branch;
* Contact planned venues to make arrangements - rooms, catering, timings etc;
* Organise transport and accommodation where necessary;
* Liaise with social secretaries in other Branches on joint events;

Should the member appointed as Social Secretary become unable to fulfil the
role, an officer appointed as Social Officer should be nominated to temporarily
fill the role until a permanent appointment to the role of Social Secretary can
be made.

### Appendix 10: Sub-committee to fulfil the role of Branch Secretary

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Tuesday 14 th January 2020 at Wigan Central_

A sub-committee will fulfil the duties required by the Branch Secretary,
dividing the responsibilities between a number of officers in order to make the
role more manageable.

The sub-committee will be headed up by one officer, with the title of Branch
Secretary, as per CAMRA’s requirements. The Branch Secretary will remain a
branch committee member and report to the Branch Chair as per the current
Branch Constitution.

A number of officers may be elected to the new role of Admin Officer. The
Admin Officer role will report to the Branch Secretary.

Some activities in the official role description are already covered by other
officers within the branch. The activities that would be required from the
sub-committee are: -

* Collate officer reports for monthly, quarterly and annual meetings;
* Circulate agendas and any supporting papers in good time;
* Check that a quorum is present at meetings;
* Circulate agendas and minutes of the annual general meeting (AGM) and any
    special or extraordinary general meetings within the time specified by the
    Branch constitution;
* Ensure up-to-date records are kept of committee membership and any changes
    are made on the Membership Database with a note to the Regional Director;
* Respond to all committee correspondence;
* Publicise meetings, events and festivals via What’s Brewing / Branch magazine
    /Branch website /social media;
* Order certificates from CAMRA’s print portal for branch and festival awards.

Should the member appointed as Branch Secretary become unable to fulfil the
role, an officer appointed as Admin Officer should be nominated to temporarily
fill the role until a permanent appointment to the role of Branch Secretary can
be made.

### Appendix 11: New Processes for Annual Awards

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Thursday 13th January 2022 at Real Crafty_

#### Timeline

##### March – Encourage members to opt-in to emails at Wigan Beer Festival

During the Wigan Beer Festival, branch members will be encouraged on entry to
opt-in to receive branch communications by email so that they can take part in
our annual awards process. This can be performed in a non-time-consuming way
either with flyers or posters in the hall with website addresses and/or QR
codes with direct links to the CAMRA website where members can update their
details and amend their communication preferences.

##### April – Email members, asking for feedback from the festival

Send out branch communications via CAMRA’s comm’s tool, asking members for
feedback from the Beer Festival. A feedback form will be designed and shared
using an online form. This will begin to engage members and get them used to
responding to our requests.

##### June – Rules for awards

Send out branch communications via CAMRA’s comm’s tool, outlining the rules and
process for our annual awards.

##### August – POTY Round 1

Send out branch communications via CAMRA’s comm’s tool with a link to a web
form. The form will have a drop-down list of all pubs in our branch area that
are marked as providing real ale. There will also be an option for ‘other’,
enabling a member to nominate a pub that we might not currently know serves
real ale. The branch can then investigate and update its records accordingly,
improving the quality of information we hold.

###### Automatic entry into Long List

The ‘long list’ will contain some automatic nominations, providing those pubs
are currently eligible for entry into the GBG as per the branch processes at
the time.

For clarity, current branch criteria for eligibility for entry into the GBG
are: -

* The pub must have continuously served real ale and/or real cider and/or real
    perry for a period of at least four months to a consistently good standard.
* The pub must not have had a change of licensee within the previous four
    months, except under exceptional circumstances wherein the new licensee has
    a recent proven track record locally.

Any changes to branch processes for GBG eligibility will supersede the above
criteria.

The automatic entries into the list of 50 will be: -

* Pubs in the current published edition of CAMRA’s Good Beer Guide (GBG)
* Pubs that won one of the four annual awards at the last AGM
* Pubs that won POTS within the last 12 months

Under normal circumstances, between 20 and 29 pubs will therefore automatically
enter the long list. The remaining spaces will be taken by those pubs that
receive the greatest number of votes.

Pubs receiving zero votes will not be added to the long list, automatically or
otherwise.

In the event of a tie, scores from NBSS will be used to break the deadlock. If
there is still a tie, the length of the long list will be reduced, removing the
lowest-scoring pubs.

##### September –CPOTY Round 1 and shortlist

Send out branch communications via CAMRA’s comm’s tool with a link to a web
form. The form will have a drop-down list of all pubs in our branch area that
are marked as providing real cider and/or real perry. There will also be an
option for ‘other’, enabling a member to nominate a pub that we might not
currently know serves real cider or real perry. The branch can then investigate
and update its records accordingly, improving the quality of information we
hold.

There are currently 24 pubs in WhatPub/Pubzilla that are marked as ‘Real Cider
outlets’ although that list likely needs to be reviewed in light of the
recently amended
[definitions of Real Cider and Perry](https://www1-camra.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/26114428/Cider-definition-May-2021-final.pdf)
from CAMRA (as updated May 2021).

A shortlist of up to five pubs will be formed from the pubs with the greatest
number of votes on the web form. The pub that was awarded CPOTY at the most
recent branch AGM will automatically enter the shortlist alongside up to four
other pubs, providing that it meets the GBG criteria as described above.

Pubs receiving zero votes will not be added to the shortlist, automatically or
otherwise.

In the event of a tie, scores from NBSS will be used to break the deadlock. If
there is still a tie, the length of the shortlist will be reduced, removing the
lowest-scoring pubs.

##### September – COTY Round 1 and shortlist

Send out branch communications via CAMRA’s comm’s tool with a link to a web
form. The form will have a drop-down list of all clubs that are marked as
providing real ale, real cider or real perry. There will also be options for
‘other’, enabling a member to nominate a club that serves real ale, real cider
or real perry. The branch can then investigate and update its records
accordingly, improving the quality of information we hold.

There are currently eight clubs in WhatPub/Pubzilla that are marked as ‘Real
Ale outlets’. There are zero clubs that are marked as real cider outlets.

A shortlist of up to five clubs will be formed from the clubs with the greatest
number of votes on the web form. The club that was awarded COTY at the most
recent branch AGM will automatically enter the shortlist alongside up to four
other clubs, providing that it meets the GBG criteria as described above.

Clubs receiving zero votes will not be added to the shortlist, automatically or
otherwise.

In the event of a tie, scores from NBSS will be used to break the deadlock. If
there is still a tie, the length of the shortlist will be reduced, removing the
lowest-scoring clubs.

##### October – POTY Round 2 – long list to shortlist

Send out branch communications via CAMRA’s comm’s tool with a link to a web
form. The form will have a drop-down list of the long list of up to 50 pubs.

Members will be asked to vote for the best pub from the long list in order to
form a shortlist of up to ten pubs.

The pub that was awarded POTY at the most recent branch AGM will automatically
enter the shortlist alongside up to nine other pubs, providing that it meets
the GBG criteria as described above.

Pubs receiving zero votes will not be added to the shortlist, automatically or
otherwise.

In the event of a tie, scores from NBSS will be used to break the deadlock. If
there is still a tie, the length of the long list will be reduced, removing the
lowest-scoring pubs.

##### November – Judging

Send out branch communications via CAMRA’s comm’s tool announcing the
shortlists for POTY, CPOTY and COTY.

Judges will be appointed by the branch from the branch membership. There will
be no limit to the number of judges. Judges may judge one, two or all three
award categories.

Judges must judge and record a complete set of scores for each of the venues on
the shortlist for the category or categories they are judging, or the scores
will not count.

Judging will be conducted as per the current CAMRA guidelines and scoring
sheets as per the regional round of the respective competition.

Scores must be recorded by the end of December in order to be counted.

The Annual Awards Subcommittee (if still formed) or Branch Committee (if the
Subcommittee has since been disbanded) reserve the right to challenge what is
perceived to be abnormal scoring during the judging process. If the relevant
committee is not satisfied following a challenge, sets of abnormal scores may
be rejected.

The winners of POTY, CPOTY and COTY will be the pub/club with the highest
average score following the judging process. In the event of a tie, scores from
NBSS will be used to break the deadlock. If there is still a tie, the winner
will be chosen by the result of a secret ballot of members attending the AGM.
If there continues to be a tie, the Branch Chair (or Acting Chair, should the
Branch Chair not be chairing the AGM) must break the deadlock with a casting
vote. The POTY, CPOTY and COTY awards must not be shared, in order that a
pub/club may progress to the regional round of the respective national
competition.

##### November – BNCO suggestions

Send out branch communications via CAMRA’s comm’s tool asking our members to
nominate pubs for the BNCO award, including as much information as possible to
help determine eligibility.

A list of pubs will be formed from the nominations that meet the eligibility
criteria.

##### December – Nominations for ComPOTY

Send out branch communications via CAMRA’s comm’s tool asking our members to
nominate pubs for the ComPOTY award, including descriptive reasons why the pub
is an asset to the community and therefore deserving of the award.

A list of pubs will be formed from the nominations.

##### January – Encourage members to attend the AGM for BNCO &amp; ComPOTY

Send out branch communications via CAMRA’s comm’s tool encouraging members to
attend the AGM to vote for BNCO and ComPOTY awards.

Voting for those two awards will take place exclusively in-person at the Branch
AGM. No online or proxy votes may be cast.

The winner of the two awards will be the pub or club with the highest number of
votes.

In the event of a tie, the award will be shared between the tied pubs/clubs.

#### Additional information

##### Online nominations/voting

Each of the web forms will ask members for their names and membership numbers.
That is to enable the branch to verify that the member has a current membership
within the Wigan branch and that each member can only vote once at each stage.

Members without access to email or the internet will be able to cast their
votes by using someone else’s device, as long as they provide their own name
and membership number.

Any occurrences of a member voting more than once at each stage will cause that
member’s votes to be rejected, regardless of whether the votes were for the
same or different pubs or clubs.

If a membership number is entered incorrectly and cannot be verified against the
membership database, that vote will not be counted.

##### Timeline variation

The timelines set out above are subject to change for any reason deemed
appropriate by the Annual Awards Subcommittee or Branch Committee.

##### Future changes to POTS process

Any changes to the branch processes for POTS will not automatically
affect the annual awards processes.

##### Name change for CPOTY

Following the adoption of the motion, the name of the Branch Cider Pub of the
Year award should be renamed to Branch Cider & Perry Pub of the Year award
(still abbreviated to CPOTY).

##### Physical prizes

Currently the winner of POTY is presented with a framed certificate and shield,
the Alan Ball Award. This motion proposes that all five annual award winners
are presented with some form of physical trophy, to be decided upon following
the adoption of this motion.
