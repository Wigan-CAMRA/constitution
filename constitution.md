## Appendices & Byelaws

### Appendix 1. Nominations for Pub of the Season (POTS)

_Added to byelaws at branch meeting on Tuesday 16th February 2016 at 
Blundell’s Café Bar._

If a pub is selected as a Pub of the Season, that pub will become ineligible
for nomination for the following three Pub of the Season awards.

E.g. if Wigan Central is voted as Pub of the Season for Spring 2016, it will
become ineligible for nomination for Pub of the Season Summer 2016, Autumn 2016
and Winter 2016. The next opportunity to nominate Wigan Central for the Pub of
the Season award will be Spring 2017.

### Appendix 2. Voting for Pub of the Season (POTS)

_Added to byelaws at branch meeting on Tuesday 16th February 2016 at
Blundell’s Café Bar._

If voting for a Pub of the Season award is taking place in a venue nominated
for the award, the voting should be concluded by way of a secret ballot as
opposed to an open show of hands as is the regular voting method.

### Appendix 3. Best New Cask Outlet award criteria

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Wednesday 17th January 2018 at Wigan
Central_

The award should go to a venue which has demonstrated its credentials over a
period of between four and sixteen calendar months from its opening or
conversion to a cask outlet

### Appendix 4. Sexist or suggestive pump clips at Wigan Beer Festival

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Wednesday 17th January 2018 at Wigan
Central_

CAMRA has clear policy on equal opportunity and discrimination. In view of this
Wigan branch agrees to adopt policies which encourage participation by all who
share our love of beer, real cider, and pubs. All members should feel
comfortable in the company of branch members and at our organised events. To
that end it is agreed that our festival will not feature any products which
have sexist or suggestive pump clips or names. Any member demonstrating
behaviour which breaches CAMRAs policies on Equality and Discrimination will be
formally challenged and if necessary reported to CAMRA’s disciplinary panel.

### Appendix 5. Voting for Pub of the Season (POTS) by proxy

_12 month trial agreed at branch meeting on Tuesday 11th April 2017 at the Tap
‘n’ Barrel._

The new voting system was trialled for a period of twelve months and used to
determine POTS for the following periods: Summer 2017; Autumn 2017
Winter 2017; Spring 2018. The trial was reviewed during the branch meeting on
Thursday 19 th April 2018 at Wigan Brewhouse and permanently added to the
branch byelaws.

A branch member who is unable to attend the meeting during which voting for
POTS is taking place may cast her/his vote by proxy providing s/he sends
apologies for absence from the meeting along with an attending branch member.
The apology must be written down (either on paper or via email or text message)
and be able to be produced by the attending member at the time of voting. The
apology should be accompanied by the wish to vote by proxy and the name of the
pub that the member wishes to vote for. It is recommended that the absent
member also includes her/his CAMRA membership number in the interest of checks
being made retrospectively to ensure that the absent member’s branch membership
is current and therefore s/he is eligible to vote for POTS.

#### Limitations: -

* An attending member at the branch meeting may only carry a maximum of two proxy
    votes for absent members;
* Should more than two absentees contact an attending branch member to pass on
    apologies, apologies may be accepted but only the first two proxy votes
    should be accepted by that member;
* By accepting a proxy vote from a non-attending member and casting it on
    her/his behalf, the attending member is vouching for the eligibility of the
    absent member to vote;
* Should any abuse of the voting system be discovered either at the time of
    voting or afterwards, appropriate disciplinary measures will be taken;
* Should any abuse of the voting system be discovered either at the time of
    voting or afterwards, an investigation will be undertaken to verify the
    validity of the award.
* The number of meetings a member has attended does not affect her/his right to
    vote;
* An absent member must directly ask an attending member to pass on apologies
    and vote;

### Appendix 6. Formalisation of Branch Pub of the Year (POTY) voting

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Wednesday 16th January 2019 at Wigan
Central_

#### Eligibility for nomination

All of the pubs that are in the current published version of the Good Beer
Guide are automatically nominated for Branch POTY, providing that at the point
of voting for the award, the pub is still eligible to be in the GBG as per the
branch regulations.

In addition, the previous four winners of branch Pub of the Season will also be
automatically nominated, again providing that the pub is eligible to be in the
GBG at the point in time of voting.

Under exceptional circumstances, additional nominations may be taken from the
floor during the AGM and, if seconded, the pub will be added to the list of
nominees at the discretion of the Branch Chair (or Acting Chair, should the
Branch Chair not be chairing the AGM).

#### Voting – phase one

Once the list of nominees is complete, a ballot by show of hands (regardless of
meeting location) will be taken. The ballot will entitle each branch member at
the AGM to a single vote for a pub during this phase. The four pubs with the
greatest number of votes will form a shortlist for phase two of voting. In the
case of a tied number of votes during phase one, the Branch Chair (or Acting
Chair) will determine the most appropriate way to form the shortlist.

#### Voting – phase two

Each attending branch member will have the option to take part in a secret
ballot (regardless of meeting location). Members may vote for a single pub from
the shortlist during this phase. The votes will be collected and counted and
the pub with the greatest number of votes shall win Branch POTY. In the case of
a tie, the Branch Chair (or Acting Chair) will break the deadlock with a casting
vote.

### Appendix 7: Branch Chair may nominate and vote for annual awards

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Wednesday 16th January 2019 at Wigan
Central_

This motion proposed that the convention be done away with, enabling the Chair
to nominate and vote for awards like any other member of the branch should s/he
wish.

### Appendix 8: Qualification for LocAle award

_Added to byelaws at branch AGM on Wednesday 16th January 2019 at Wigan
Central_

Criteria for qualification for LocAle award are as follows: -

* There should always be a locally brewed real ale available on the bar
  * “Locally brewed” defined as a beer brewed by any brewery within the branch
    boundaries or brewed by a brewery within ten miles of the pub by the
    shortest driving route
* The pub must have been open and serving locally brewed real ale for a minimum
    period of four months, in line with the minimum length of time a pub must
    have been open before becoming eligible for the annual ‘Best New Cask
    Outlet’ award
* The LocAle award will be valid for a period of twelve months after the pub is
    presented with the award and will automatically renew unless the pub is
    found to no longer be eligible for LocAle status (i.e. there is no longer
    locally brewed real ale available or it is found to not be of a good
    standard upon inspection)
* The beer must always be served to a high standard

Branch members are encouraged to regularly visit LocAle accredited pubs within
the branch and report back to the branch and LocAle Coordinator any positive or
negative findings from those visits. Naturally, there may be times when a
barrel of real ale has to be changed and a new locally brewed real ale might
not be immediately available. That should be taken into consideration when
considering eligibility.
